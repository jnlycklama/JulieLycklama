			<h2>$8.75</h2>
			<img src="875/apple-touch-icon.png" />
			<p>The 875 WebApp was designed to make it easier for students with a meal plan to select what they wanted from Tim Horton's. As many Queen's students know, lines can become long quickly when students hum and haw over what to get with the money left of their $8.75 for a meal. Our app speeds up this process, so students can calculate what they want to buy before they get to the front of the line.</p>
			<p>This project was made during the Queen's University Hackathon in 2014. I worked on it with 4 other teammates for 30 hours, implementing the project using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and JSON</p>

			<h2>DJ Mishap</h2>
			<img src="DJ.png" width="40%" />
			<p>This website is for a friend of mine who was looking to advertise his DJ skills. It shows off my skills using databases with a comment section, allowing users to comment on events they have attended. Additionally, there is a list of his upcoming events, prices for hire, and samples of his mixes. </p>
			<p>The website was made as a final project in one of my classes. I worked on it alone, implementing the project using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and SQL.</p>

			<h2>WalkSafe</h2>
			<img src="WalkSafe.png" width="40%"/>
			<p>This app is currently being created for Microsoft's Imagine Cup competition. Myself and a team of three others submitted a video pitch for the app idea, and we won an Honourable Mention in our category.</p>
			<p>We are currently in the process of creating the app using Visual Studios and Cordova. Once the app is finished, I can release the details behind the idea!</p>
